# Face Mask Detection

This repository contains a Machine Learning project that aims to build a model capable of detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

In the wake of the global pandemic, wearing face masks has become a crucial preventive measure. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can effectively detect the presence or absence of a face mask on a person.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle. It consists of images categorized into two classes - 'with_mask' and 'without_mask'.

Please download the dataset from [this link](<provide_link_here>) and place it in the root of the project directory.

## Steps to follow

This project guides you through the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for model building.
2. **Model Building**: Designing a suitable machine learning model for the task.
3. **Model Training**: Training the model using the preprocessed dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model.

## Requirements

To run the scripts and notebooks, you'll need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `opencv`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python tensorflow
```

Or, if you prefer using PyTorch:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python torch torchvision
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Download and extract the dataset in the project directory.
4. Run the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks in the following order: Preprocessing -> Model Building -> Model Training -> Model Evaluation.
